# Introduction
Mealée utilizes the Yelp Fusion API to create a tournament-style game in which businesses near you, and according to your specifications, "battle" each other for your favor.

This WebApp was inspired by the many instances in my life in which I have felt overwhelmed with options! Rather than endlessly hemming and hawing over the possibilities, wouldn't it be nice to make a fast--but informed--decision?

Mealée highlights important information for you to make your decisions quickly. The closer option's distance is highlighted, and, if an option has a higher Yelp rating (provided it has a sufficient amount of ratings in the first place),  this will also be highlighted. Users can also click a business's image to see its Yelp page.

Craving Italian, but don't know which restaurant? Looking for lunch ideas in general? What about a gym, or a place to buy shoes, or even  museums? Mealée makes it easy, and it's a great tool to discover new places to try out!
